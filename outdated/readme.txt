Scripts in this directory are obsolete and no longer needed in the project.
They are kept here temporarily for personal learning process and documentation.

At some point in my learning journey, I tried to play around with certain
concepts I learned, but after deeper research, learned that there were better
more modern approaches to handling the scripts intneded purpose.

Therefore, for one reason or another, they have been made obsolete.
